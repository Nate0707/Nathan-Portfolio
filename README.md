99 bottles.py

I liked the 99 bottles py becasue it help me understand a little more on how loops can help with a decreacing value. If a decreacing value starting from 99 to 1 while using a loop made sense after runting the code which is why i liked it. 

Final.py

I like this code becasue it has conditinals, variables, and loops. I like that i have to come up with somthing and i made it come to life using what we have learned. 

character generator.py

I reallly liked this code becasue i got to come up with my own names that all connect with eachother which was actually fun. It was cool coming up with what can be the multiple end results. 

simple_calc.py

I liked this code becasue it made me think how maybe this is how my calculator works which is kind of cool. I liked that this was a simple calculator but makes me wonder how much more complex a grapghing calculator can be.
