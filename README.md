99 bottles.py

I liked the 99 bottles py becasue it help me understand a little more on how loops can help with a decreacing value. If a decreacing value starting from 99 to 1 while using a loop made sense after runting the code which is why i liked it. 

Final.py

I like this code becasue it has conditinals, variables, and loops. I like that i have to come up with somthing and i made it come to life using what we have learned. 

character generator.py

I reallly liked this code becasue i got to come up with my own names that all connect with eachother which was actually fun. It was cool coming up with what can be the multiple end results. 

simple_calc.py

I liked this code becasue it made me think how maybe this is how my calculator works which is kind of cool. I liked that this was a simple calculator but makes me wonder how much more complex a grapghing calculator can be.  

spongebob bikini bottom final formatted code.py

I really liked this project becasue we go to do this with groups and we all came up with an idea that we achived. I also liked that i figured out the angles to give the sence that 3 dimention look.

Slot_machine.py 
i liked this code becasue it used a lot of if statments that all in the end created a game that i didnt even knew existed or thought of this way. I also liked how i learned how to add on the the if statment as the credites build up if they keep winning. 

dog_breeds.py
i liked how we usde a spreadsheet to gather our information about the dogs to put them in a list and it was intresting that if the lists are in order with multiple list they can link. i liked how i could use the lists to categorize the dogs in small, medium, and large. 

image_display.py
i liked how i learned how to display an image on cs50 code space, it's intresting how it can display just by a link in a function. I also though it was intresting learning about copy rigths and how we have to give credit even with images. 

magic8ball.py
i liked how the code gave you multiple out comes with just 8 responses to the inputed question the player asked. it was cool that a code that is supposed to be like an actual 8 ball works really well with randamizing the responses. 

CREATE.py
i liked how we had the freedom to pick what we want to create and i really liked how i wanted to show somthing little that has to do with realestate. i used a list and another that were linked and i liked how i used the things i learned from this class to make code that i like.
